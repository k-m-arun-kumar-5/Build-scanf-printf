Project using LPC2138, included with design, development, simulated and tested, using a simulator, are as follows :
====================================================================================================================
1: Scalable 5 floor single elevator controller by using LPC2138 microcontroller.
2: Implementation of function operation of scanf, sscanf, printf, sprintf, gets, puts, putchar and getchar using Embedded C in LPC2138 microcontroller.
3: Single user account authentication with authentication timeout.
 
CAUTION:
========
Schematics and simulation is done by Proteus CAD. NOT EXPERIMENTED IN REAL TIME ENVIRONMENT.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for LEARNING AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. It can be used as the open source and freeware.
